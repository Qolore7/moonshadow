# Changelog

## Version 1.1.0
Due to a few major updates and additions (mostly Requiem-related), this update is NOT save-game compatible. This update also includes some more targeted visual enhancements to areas of the game I felt lacking while still sticking to the philosophy of being lightweight and performance friendly.

General:
- Completely reorganized the left pane to be more cohesive, no effect on overwrites or anything

Updated:
- All mods have been updated to the latest version (most notably USSEP, Requiem, Paradigm, and the Environs series)

Added: 
- ALT - The Snow Elves Throne
- Animated Ice Floats
- Bloody Mammoth Carcasses + Optimized textures
- Cathedral Night Skies
- CC Farming Rebalanced
- Deadly Spell Impacts
- Detailed Carriages 2.0
- Embers XD Lite
- Enahnced Landscapes - Dead Marsh Standalone
- Flies Around Corpses
- GKB Waves + Redone
- Glorious Doors of Skyrim
- Grass Sampler Fix
- Journeyman - A Fast Travel Overhaul
- Markarth Mossy AF Lite
- Moonshadow Dragonborn Reqtified (custom plugin that delevels the Dragonborn DLC and makes some other minor tweaks to be more consistent with Requiem. Not at all comprehensive or complete, but better than nothing )
- Missives - The Witcher Board
- Mists of Tamriel + Settings Loader
- NPCs React to Invisibility
- RemoveAllItems Freeze Fix
- Requiem Noxcrab's Tweaks (Birthsigns Redone and Races Redone)
- Requiem - Small Tweaks (Alduin Redone, Disarm Shout Replacer, General NPC Tweaks, Knockdown Tweak, and Vampire Collection)

- Splashes of Storms
- Static Skill Leveling Rewritten
- Skyrim Skill Uncapper (only to disable skill usage for Static Skill Leveling Rewritten)
- TAA Deblur

Removed:

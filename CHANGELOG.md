# Changelog

## Version 1.0.2

- Added Better Windhelm Ground Meshes (Icy Windhelm version)
- Updated Mysticism
- Fixed clipping objects at Skyforge
- Tweaked difficulty damage mults to that of Valravn (faster paced combat that B&B default but stil balanced imo)
- Ran Lowered Hands through CAO to fix non-coverted anims, also hid h2h anims so there's no more weirdness with fists
- Fixed more installer issues (hopefully)

## Version 1.0.1b

- Moved over to using the custom stock game folder feature of Wabbajack to avoid further issues with install (sorry for the growing pains! hopefully there won't need to be too many more updates like this)

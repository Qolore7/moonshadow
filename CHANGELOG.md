# Changelog

## Version 1.2.0 - Unreleased

Another update that is NOT save-game compatible, due to a few major mod updates, additions, and a few minor removals :( I really want this to be the last one barring any new major mod updates or releases, as I do view this update to be the end of "beta" for this list. Also, I apologize for the hectic nature of this changelog, there's a lot of moving parts and I did not keep myself well-organized. With that, let's get into the changes:

Changes:
- Re-did the left pane of MO2 to be more coherent and organized
- Added notes to many mods that have custom changes
- Compressed/packed various texture mods to save performance and drive space (shouldn't be any noticeable quality difference)
- Added optional ultra-wide support (un-tested as I do not have an ultra-wide monitor, but it should work)
- Fixed all meta file mod versions
- Trimmed down the list by removing a handful of mods I viewed as unnecessary (nothing gameplay related, just a couple minor mesh fixes and animation mods. Didn't keep an actual list cause I'm dumb)
- Switched to the "No Looped Idle" versions of various DAR animation mods to hopefully prevent rare crashes

Added:
- A brand new custom ReShade preset! Based on the coloring from Rudy ENB but with next to no performance loss. Screenshots will be available when the list updates

Updated:
Everything that needed updating, I didn't really keep track but here are a couple highlights:
- Master of One (new unarmed perks + new recommendation of just one perk per level)
- Paradigm (brand new archetypes)
- Scrambled Bugs (bunch of brand new fixes)
- DynDoLOD Output (higher quality while also increasing performance)
- All Moonshadow custom patches/nemesis/synthesis/etc

Removed:
- Configurable Perks Per Level (as mentioned earlier, Master of One now recommends just one perk per level)
- EVG Conditional Idles (was overall not happy with the quality of the animations)
- Dimmer Fog (replaced by No More Blinding Fog)
- Mari's Flora (has been mostly replaced by Cathedral 3D's flora no, plus the remaining ones were rather performance intensive due to the new meshes)
- Precision/Creatures (overall was not happy with combat with it. the new reach lengths, while realistic, are more detremental to gameplay than anything imo)
- Taunting Matters (was pretty OP imo due to the short animation time and the fact that it could easily be done outside of combat)
- AI Overhaul (ended up feeling pretty clunky through no fault of the mod itself but rather Skyrim's stiff animation and dialogue)
- Extended Encounters (pretty much the same reason as above)
- SkyTEST Lite 

## Version 1.1.0

The first of (hopefully very few) major and non-save safe updates. Sorry to anyone who already started a playthrough! If you are fond of your character however you can just stick with version 1.0.2, it is still perfectly functional. Perhaps the biggest change is removing Skyrim Unbound, which I'll go into below:

Skyrim Unbound has been removed in favor of [Paradigm - A Quick Start Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85939). I'm sure a lot of players will miss the added RP elements that unbound brings, but as soon as I saw Paradigm release I was ready to make the switch. Although you lose the ability to start anywhere (which I think is actually a good thing for this list, I'll talk about that later), Paradigm adds a wonderful and seamless class system reminscent of previous TES games. Unlike other class mods, the classes don't provide overpowered new perks or abilities. They simply change what your starting gear is at the beginning of the game. All the options are very balance and in my opinion makes up for the lack of being able to choose a starting location. Plus, I've actually come to realize that I don't think its a great idea to allow the player to start anywhere with this list. Since the list is based around being unleveled, some starting areas would be near impossible to take on from level one (I learned this the hard way) due to the high level enemies, so the player will have to resort to going to starting areas like Riverwood or Whiterun anyways just to begin to progress. I hope that makes sense :)

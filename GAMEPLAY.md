## Gameplay

These are just the highlights, there are many more mods included!

### Requiem
[Requiem](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60888) is the core mod that this modlist is based upon. If you are unfamiliar with the mod and want to learn more, I highly recommend watching [Greed Gaming's great breakdown video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG7D8meR0cY). Please note that some of the features talked about in the video are changed in Moonshadow, such as nerfing Alchemy, but it still captures the main features. [Requiem - Minor Arcana](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61342) is a small Requiem addon mod updated and maintained by one of the lead Requiem devs that aims to increase roleplaying opportunities and flesh out otherwise lacking areas of the game. [Requiem - Magic Redone](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59302) completely rebalances all schools of magic in Requiem and adds many new viable spells and build options. [Requiem - Noxcrab's Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42591) is used to nerf alchemy, making hunting a more viable playstyle, and tweak various resistence and regeneration stats on enemies to create a more balanced experience. Perhaps most notably, there are no mods in this list that try to intgrate the Dragonborn DLC into Requiem. After testing, I was unhappy with any mods that attempted to do so and decided that it would be best to ignore the DLC until it is officially adressed by Requiem.

### Progression

- [Paradigm - A Quick Start Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85939)

- [Valravn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53869) (only the movement and AI changes are used as Requiem already covers the rest)
- [Realistic AI Detection](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2345) along with [RAID Weathers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63116) and [Ambiance](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46383) to create the most balanced AI detection possible
- [No Saving in Combat](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29914)
- [Simple Degredation](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74790)

### New Content
- **Creation Club Content** - A highly curated selection of the paid creations are used in Moonshadow. All of the new armor and crossbow creations are fully integrated by Requiem. Moonshadow also integrates Camping, Backpacks, Fishing, and Farming, which have all been rebalanced and tweaked to better fit the modlist.

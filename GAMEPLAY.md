# Gameplay Guide

## Overview

Moonshadow is built around "double-edged" gameplay, meaning that racial abilities, standing stones, and even perks come with both positives and negatives. Building a character is no longer about simply filling out a perk tree and getting numbers as high as possible. Intense thought and strategy need to go into building a character and leveling. Immersion and roleplaying are paramount to Moonshadow. Live life as you see fit. Are you the one and only Dragonborn destined to save the world? Or perhaps you're a simple blacksmith just trying to make an honest living in Skyrim? Explore the harsh and unforgiving land of Skyrim however you see fit. Moonshadow prioritizes simple and intuitive mechanics. The goal is for the player to not need to break their immersion and pace of play by having to check a wiki to figure out how to complete simple tasks. If you have any suggestions for mechanics that need better explaining in-game, let me know! 

This guide highlights major mods included in Moonshadow in the following categories:

- [Hotkeys](#hotkeys)
- [Gameplay Changes](#gameplay-changes)
  - [Overhauls](#overhauls)
  - [New Mechanics](#new-mechanics)

## Hotkeys

W.I.P.

## Gameplay

### Overhauls

Moonshadow is built around a few core mods that overhaul the traditional gameplay and progression of Skyrim without adding unfair, confusing, or poorly-implemented mechanics/features. 

- [Master of One](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47024) - A perk overhaul that transforms perks from generic character progression into a means to craft unique and specialized builds. Perks are no longer flat bonuses, but rather come with buffs and debuffs to encourage specialization and thorough character building. Completely transforms character building and progression whilst only utilizing the vanilla perk and leveling system. All perks have five ranks. The first rank of any given perk will not have any debuffs. The remaining four ranks will provide steady buffs but exponentially increasing debuffs as well. Maxing out every perk in any given tree might not be best for your character, so be careful!

  > With Moonshadow, you will start the game with two free perk points. Choose wisely! You will also recieve two perk points per level which is the value recommended by Master of One. This is configurable via the MCM.

- [Legacy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36415) - An overhaul of the racial abilities and bonuses in the same vain as Master of One. All races have positives and negatives.

  > :ledger: By default, Legacy lets you choose a racial bonus reguardless of your chosen race. This feature is removed in Moonshadow, but if you so please you can change your racial ability in the MCM. 

- [Curse of the Firmament](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28419) - An overhaul of the Standing Stones in the same vein as Legacy and Master of One.

- [Skyrim Revamped - Loot and Encounter Zones](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14338) - Leveled list and Encounter Zone Overhaul that delevels and world and decentralizes the world from the player. 

- [Apothecary](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52130) - Rebalances Food and Alchemy

- [Blade and Blunt](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34549) - A lightweight combat enhancement which makes combat more engaging

- [Scion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41639) - Rebalances and improves Vampires including changes that make both Stage 1 and Stage 4 vampirism desirable

- [Manbeast](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44746) - Rebalance and content addon for werewolves which introduces new perks and abilities

- [Mysticism](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839) - A magic overhaul which fixes balance issues and introduces new spells

- [Thamaturgy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57138) - An enchanting overhaul which fixes some major issues with enchanting balance

- [Forceful Tongue](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36276) - A lightweight shouts overhaul, designed to balance in a sensible manner this underwhelming but cool mechanic

### New Mechanics

- [Skyrim Souls](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27859) - Unpauses all game menus. Make sure you come prepared!

- [Skyrim Unbound Reborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27962) - An alternate start mod with a wide range of options, including the ability to play as a non-Dragonborn character

- [SunHelm](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39414) - All in one survival and needs mod focused on being as simple and streamlined possible.

- [Know Your Enemies Redux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55045) & [Know Your Enemies Redux - Armors](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55045) - Fixes the repetitiveness of Skyrim's combat by adding specific traits and weaknesses to different creature and armor types. Traits and weaknesses are discoverable in-game in an immersive way through a less power and a series of books.

- [No Saving in Combat](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29914) - Disables saving in combat to prevent cheesing certain fights.

- [Challenging Spell Learning](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20521) - You no longer instantaneously "consume" spell tomes to learn a spell. Reading a spell tome will now start a learning ritual that tests your magical abilities. During the ritual your magicka will steadily drain, and to learn the spell you must complete the ritual without running out of magicka. Characters without substantial magicka investment can no longer learn master-level spells. 

- [Acolyte](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/75269) - Shrines and amulets allow the player to accept a divine covenant with a god. At low devotion, the covenant is costly to the player, providing an obstacle to work through as proof of your faith. At high devotion, the covenant is extremely beneficial with five powerful gifts for each divine.

- [Missives](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17576) - Adds a large number of localized radiant quests found at Missive Boards in towns and cities. Very useful for low-level characters getting started. 

- [Honed Metal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/80705) - ALlows blacksmiths and mages all over Skyrim will be able to craft, temper and enchant your equipment.

- [Simple Degredation](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74790) - Adds a simple weapon condition system based on the vanilla tempering system. Tempered items will slowly degrade back to the untempered state over time. Items will never break, only degrade back to their base version. 

And many, many more small changes and tweaks that are best discovered on your own!
